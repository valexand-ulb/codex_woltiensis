# Codex Woltiensis Songbook App

This Flutter application is a digital songbook for the "Codex Woltiensis üêá", a small collection of songs that we've compiled for easy reference and use. With this app, you'll be able to view and search for songs, as well as save your favorites for easy access.
‚ö†Ô∏è There will be no more commit until the end of june. Waiting for code review.
## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you'll need to have Flutter installed on your machine. You can find detailed instructions for installing Flutter [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

## Acknowledgements
‚ö†Ô∏è This project is made by a student trying to learn the flutter framework. The code will be subject to a lot of changes for learning purposes.

We'd like to thank the contributors to this project, as well as the creators of the Flutter framework and the Codex Woltiensis songbook. Without their hard work, this project wouldn't be possible.
