# Codex Woltiensis Songbook App

This Flutter application is a digital songbook for the "Codex Woltiensis üêá", a small collection of songs that we've compiled for easy reference and use. With this app, you'll be able to view and search for songs, as well as save your favorites for easy access.
## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you'll need to have Flutter installed on your machine. You can find detailed instructions for installing Flutter [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Once you have Flutter installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
$ https://github.com/valexand-ulb/codex_woltiensis.git
```


From there, you can open the project in your favorite IDE or text editor, and run it using the Flutter CLI or by clicking the "run" button in your IDE.

A security warning may appear, but you can safely ignore it and install the app.
